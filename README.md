# Brickbreaker
A classic brickbreaker game written in Java.

Breakout consists of a playing field of bricks, a paddle, and a ball.
The objective of the game is to bounce the ball off the paddle in order to destroy the bricks.
When the bricks are all destroyed, you have beaten the level.
However, if the ball misses the paddle, you will lose a life.
Once you have 0 lives left, you lose the game.

How to play: The only controls you will need are the left and right arrow keys 
			 (which control the direction that the paddle moves). If you would 
			 like to start a new game, simply click the 'New Game' button.

Cool features:
 -Bricks take multiple hits and change color each time they are hit. If a yellow 
  brick is hit, it will be destroyed.
 
 -Once the first level is complete, a new level will appear.
 
 -One random block in the playing field will contain a power-up that brings 
  an extra blue ball into play. The blue ball may go away without penalty, but
  the red ball must always be in play.
